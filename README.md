# Intro Stats Course Documents

Some items for teaching introductory stats courses are hosted here. I do not own most of these items (most of them are from OpenIntro). This is simply a repo for data to be pulled from more easily using inline code. I do own the .R files used for data cleaning and such, but not the data sets or anything pulled from other sources.
